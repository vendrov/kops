## This document will be used to build the release notes for kops 1.9


# Significant changes

* RBAC is now the default authorization mode for new clusters.  Existing clusters will not be changed.  Pass `--authorization=AlwaysAllow` to `kops create cluster` for the legacy authorization behaviour.

* Federation support has been removed from kops, reflecting the removal of federation upstream and refocusing on multicluster efforts.
